            <p>Adidas AG (German pronunciation: [ˈadiˌdas] ⓘ; stylized in all lowercase since 1949)[4] is a German multinational athletic apparel and footwear corporation headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. It is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and also the second largest in the world, after Nike.[5][6] It is the holding company for the Adidas Group, which also owns an 8.33% stake in the football club Bayern Munich, and Runtastictrian fitness technology company. Adidas's revenue for 2024 was listed at €23 billion.[3] Adidas is best known for their iconic brand image, offering the Yeezy Boost sneakers, and is publicly recognized for their extensive long origin history for participating in sponsored athletes, for providing gear in the FIFA World Cup series. The brand is also unique for performance innovation of their shoes with major deep ties with sports culture, and durability with their focus of sport shoes, clothing, backpacks, and other accessories. Its commitment to sustainability includes their digital technology and AI, including collaborating with cultural figures like Lionel Messi, Patrick Mahomes, Real Madrid, and Pharrell Williams.

The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house. He was joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory"). Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas's business rival.[1]

The three stripes are Adidas's identity mark, having been used on the company's clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid. The branding, which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for the equivalent of €1,600 and two bottles of whiskey,[7][8] became so successful that Dassler described Adidas as "The three stripes company".[7][8]

Adidas' main status is to reach net zero by the end of 2050, by following its profits amounted to 1.2 billion euros, weather forecast, and for its full-year profit outlook growth. The most successful shoe from Adidas is the "Samba", which is gained popularity and due to the retro, versatility, indoor soccer-inspired style.[9]</p>
